# Function is Java Script:
## JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task, it is executed when it has been called.

### Function Syntax:
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
### Notes:
#### - these parameters should be sent between parentheses () when the function is called. 
#### -  these parameters behave as local variables.

## Function calling/ invocation:
### - When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)

### - When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
### - Automatically (self invoked)

## Function Return
#### When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
