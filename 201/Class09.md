## Forms:
- How to collect information from visitors
- Different kinds of form controls
- New HTML5 form controls

Whenever you want to collect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
(form) element.
X Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
X Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.
X HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it
easier for visitors to fill in forms.

## Lists, Tables & Forms
- Specifying bullet point styles
- Adding borders and backgrounds to tables
- Changing the appearance of form elements

In addition to the CSS properties covered which work with the contents of all elements,there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms. List markers can be given different appearances
using the list-style-type and list-style image
properties. Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
different browsers, but there are properties you can
use to control them and make them more consistent.
XForms are easier to use if the form controls are
vertically aligned using CSS.
Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more
interactive.

## Events
Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked). Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon. When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user. You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element. The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in  the HTMLS specification as well as browser-specific events.
