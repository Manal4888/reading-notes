## Summary
- The 'table' element is used to add tables to a web
page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the (<tr>) element.
X Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the (<td>) element (or (<th>) if it is a
header).
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a (<thead>),
(<tbody>), and  (<tfoot>).

Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144); 

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value. An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
-  Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
 - JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 
 - Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets (and both can contain the other).
