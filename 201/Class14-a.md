# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations

##  CSS Transforms(The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional)

With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

- Transform Syntax
- 2D Transforms (2D Rotate,2D Scale,2D Translate,2D 
Skew)
- Combining Transforms ( rotating and scaling )
- Transform Origin (the default transform origin is the dead center of an element, both 50% horizontally and 50% vertically. To change this default origin position the transform-origin property may be used.)
- Perspective (individual perspectives with a group of elements)
-3D Transforms (3D Rotate,3D Scale,3D Translate,3D 
Skew)
-Transform Style (Backface Visibility)

## CSS Transitions & Animations

- With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

- Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.
