# Chart.js, Canvas

## Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.;

## We can create CHARTS WITH CHART.JS:;


## Drawing a line chart 
## Drawing a pie chart;
## Drawing a bar chart;


### **Highlights:**
* Basic usage of canvas (canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas)
