### Building Blocks;

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box

## Summary

- "div" elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

-  Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
-  Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page
